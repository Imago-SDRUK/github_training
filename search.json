    "text": "GitHub is for teamwork\nGitHub exists to support working together. The main selling points of GitHub are that you can:\n\nMake work and decision-making visible and traceable\nMake changes reviewable, so that our colleagues can understand them and work with them more effectively\nMake changes reversible if something goes wrong!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGitHub is not just a tool for storing code!\nIt is a collaboration and project management platform. Using it is about more than just pushing and pulling code - using it effectively means embracing new ways of working.\n\n\n\nThis is different from using Git and GitHub individually!\nFor your own individual projects, a lot of this stuff may not be necessary (although much of it is still good practice!). For those projects, you can rely solely on your own documentation or notes. Ideas can live inside your head with no problems since you are the only one implementing them.\nFor team projects - progress is bottlenecked by how well we can work with one another. If a 5 member team all have different documentation/working practices, sharing ideas and working together becomes much more complex as we need to reconcile all of these ways of working first.\n\n\nCommunication is key\nThe main principle here is communication. By better documenting our ideas, we can reduce ambiguity, make decisions (both big and small!) visible and collaborative, invite feedback on ideas and implementation, and ensure we have an evolving, living, shared history of our products.\nThis lets us communicate:\n\nwhat we did\nwhy we did it\nwhat alternatives were considered\nwhat worked (and what didn’t)\n\nThe technical issues (e.g. merge conflicts, issues with Quarto) that were flagged by the PDRAs are all traceable to workflow issues! Rather than fix the symptom, I aim to remedy the cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCommunication is easier when we break things down! A recurring theme throughout the workshop will be splitting large, complex pieces of work into smaller, digestible chunks. This lets us communicate and develop our core ideas with less noise, makes writing Issues, pull requests and code reviews much easier, and minimises the likelihood of merge conflicts occurring.\n\n\n\n\nBuy-in is required…\nGitHub only helps us if we use the tools it provides.\nThat does come with some initial overhead - learning the workflow, changing habits and getting used to documenting your work as you go. The sooner we start learning them the better!\n\n\n… but this is not a list of rules\nThese guidelines are intended to be pragmatic, not dogmatic; a good enough practices to follow. The aim is to convince you that this workflow is worth using, rather than dictating that you have to!\nEven if you don’t implement this workflow exactly, knowing when and why to use Issues/branches etc. will help you to build good habits even if your habits differ.",

If your idea stays private, it may be forgotten or half-implemented. Turning that into an Issue gives the team a permanent record of that idea that they can look at at any time, iterate with you on or even try and implement themselves.\nWe do have other resources to share ideas (Teams, weekly meetings). The advantage of using GitHub is that Issues are more searchable and findable than e.g. threads on Teams, and less likely to be forgotten about and more likely to be discussed compared to individual meeting notes.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration benefits\nIssues make collaboration easier in multiple ways. Teammates can see what you are working on and suggest ideas. Reviewers can understand the motivation behind your changes, and see alternatives you tried (and discarded).\nThey can be a useful way to frame e.g. line management meetings; ideas and outcomes can be written down in Issues related to that piece of work, which creates a fixed, findable record of the ideas and suggestions made.\n\n\n\nSetting up an issue does not imply you need to work on it right now!\nCreating an Issue does not mean you are committing to implementing it immediately. In fact, it can be a really key benefit of Issues - getting in the habit of using them might make you take a step back and think about things at a high level before diving into writing code.\nIf you notice a problem, think of an improvement, have an idea you don’t yet have time for, whatever, open an Issue anyway. Even a short Issue now is better than a forgotten idea later.",

Even one or two sentences of context can be immensely helpful.\nEven creating an Issue that is just a title and a couple of sentences writes down the idea somewhere that is searchable and readable on demand.\nThe Pareto principle applies: 20% extra effort = 80% of the benefit!\n\n\n\n\nSplitting work with sub‑issues\nIssues should be used for both small pieces of work (squashing bugs) and more ambitious (whole-scale rewriting of a codebase, creating new data products).\nFor large pieces of work (e.g. “design a whole new sub‑product”), create an Issue, but you can then also create sub-Issues to track particular bits of work, e.g.:\n\nWhat science questions need answering?\nWhat technical problems need solving?\nWhat data or validation is required?\n\n\n\nLinking Issues to code\nYour Issue should reference the branch you are working on once it is made. This links several parts of our main workflow together:\n\nIssue -&gt; Branch -&gt; Commits -&gt; Pull Request -&gt; Review -&gt; Merge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGitHub will auto‑link Issues and pull requests (PRs) if:\nthe branch is created from the Issue or you mention #issue-number in commits or PR descriptions, e.g. typing\ncloses #23\nwill prompt a link to #23.\n\n\n\n\nUse labels!\nLabels let you give an easily viewable, high level overview of the type of thing you’re trying to solve. For example, a bug label implies that your colleagues should probably take a look at your Issue, since it may affect their work. You can use the good first issue or help wanted labels to indicate that certain people should help out with your Issue, etc.",

Annual processing was already stretching memory limits on the server.\n\n\n\n\nComment 1 (by @original_author)\n\nI’ve added season to config.yaml, which can now be either annual (default behaviour as before) or seasonal.\nimago-toolkit/pull/25 in imago-toolkit has been set up to merge in the support for seasonal processing in the main pipeline.\nI tried a few things in /demo/seasonal_testing.ipynb. Using datetime out-of-the-box didn’t work because of the input data format. However, polars has a utility (foo) that we can use directly on the input DataFrame - this seems to work!\nNext step is that memory issue… any ideas @helpful_rseperson?\n\n\n\nComment 2 (by @helpful_rseperson)\n\nI think we can solve the memory issue using chunking. Rather than processing each tile sequentially in a loop, we can use dask DataFrames - these are read in lazily, so we break up each file into bits that can fit into memory.\nSee (link_to_docs) for more info. I think if you replace:\n&lt;python_code_with_loops&gt;\nwith\n&lt;python_code_with_chunked_tasks&gt;\nthis should now work. Let me know how it goes - shout if you need help!",

For team work: don’t.\n\n\n\nWhy committing to main is a problem in team projects\nIn a team‑based project, committing directly to main means that the team loses sight of what is being put in the main branch.\nThis causes several problems:\n\nloss of visibility into what changed and why\nno opportunity for teammates to question assumptions, or suggest improvements\nno shared understanding of how the codebase evolved\n\n\nCommitting directly to main also makes merge conflicts way more likely!\nWe will learn more about these on day 2. Merge conflicts happen when two people change the same part of the code in different ways. Using pull requests we can control this; with commits to main we cannot.\nFor these reasons, many projects explcitly prohibit people from being able to push directly to main.\n\n\n\n\nYou mean there’s a better way?\n\nCreate a branch (or fork).

The aim of your PR text should be to inform your code reviewer enough info they need to decide if it is ready for the main branch.\n\nKeep your potential reviewer in the loop with your Issues\nIf there is a high-level problem with what you are proposing, it is better to resolve it there than after going through all the effort to implement it! Issues are where these kind of discussions should happen - your reviewer should not be blindsided by your PR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour reviewer is not inside your head! The more info you can provide them about the intent of your changes, the easier it is to mentally map changes to outputs.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a useful, succinct title to set the scene\nThe most important thing to get right is the title! This not only helps your reviewer to know what they are in for, but also provides a searchable reference to the PR that you can look at later.\nYour title should refer to the thing that you are aiming to add with your PR - this frames the discussion you have within the PR.\n\n\nUse labels\n\nLabels are a useful way to categorise whatever problem it is you are working on. For example, a PR with the bug keyword might be a high priority for a team member to look at and therefore contribute to, or refactor might indicate that the core functionality of your code should stay the same, directing the reviewer to focus on testing whether that is the case.\nUsing labels like this means that someone can quickly triage whether they need to respond to your PR now or later.\n\n\n\nShow, don’t tell\nIt is much easier to review code if you can demonstrate that it does what you claim.\nDepending on the project, this might include:\n\nscreenshots\nexample outputs\nplots\nlogs\ncommands that reproduce a result\ntests (see below)\n\n\nIf a reviewer can quickly verify behaviour themselves, reviews are faster and less hassle.\n\nEven better is to explicitly say how you can reproduce the results you are promising - e.g. \n\n“run demo/clive_flood_processing_demo.ipynb with data from demo/data/test_data.nc to verify”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAdvanced - automated testing is industry standard for software developers\n\n\n\nWith tests:\n\nwe can check that existing behaviour is retained (i.e. all the old tests pass)\nwe can look at and run the tests to illustrate for ourselves that the code works as intended.\nif it doesn’t work - we can pinpoint which parts are failing and focus our time and effort into looking at interactions between the existing code and the new code here.\n\nIt is then possible to automate the process of testing for branches being PR’d into main via GitHub Actions - the PR will then automatically tell you if the tests no longer work.\nOur main imago repository (the toolkit used by the RSEs to put all of your/our ideas into production) is an example of where to look - tests live in the tests folder, which are run by pytest using a GitHub Actions runner (.github/workflows/python-package.yml)\nA future workshop may cover automated testing and GitHub Actions. For now, don’t worry too much about it - just know that it is something that can make your life easier for later!",

    "text": "Resolving merge conflicts\nThe best way to resolve conflicts by updating your branch with main (merge main into your branch), then fixing conflicts locally.\nIn the updated diagram below, we merge main into B2 and end up with a new updated file BA2. We then can resolve any conflicts and merge the PR into main where we end up with our final file (A2).\n\nbranch B1:       - B1 -\n               /        \\ \nmain:      A0 ----------- A1 ------ A2\n               \\                \\  /\nbranch B2:       - B2 - - - - - - BA2 \n\nHow exactly any conflicts in this merge are resolved depends on the type of file - they can sometimes be painless, or sometimes very hard to deal with.\n\nThe nice version\nText files are fairly simple to fix, and can be done within GitHub’s interface. When merging the main branch into your branch, you will see something like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\ndef greet():\n    print(\"Hello from my branch!\")\n=======\ndef greet():\n    print(\"Hello from main!\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; main\nThe “incoming” changes in this case is the main branch that you are trying to merge into the “current” branch (your feature branch, B2 in the example above). ======= is a separator between these. You can then fix the merge conflict by removing the extra git padding and code from the version you don’t want to keep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOn GitHub or in VSCode, there are buttons you can click to select which set of changes you want to keep - this will fix the formatting automatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe not-so-nice version\nJupyter notebooks are another major source of merge conflicts. In principle, it is easy enough to track changes in these files since they are text format, just with much more text to edit. However, since e.g. cell execution counts/output can change, this makes it very complex in practice.\nPossible solutions are:\n\nmove core logic to scripts (R/Python)\nStrip outputs from notebooks before committing - these are likely causes of complex diffs (e.g. execution counts).\nDon’t work collaboratively on notebooks where possible - this is likely to cause merge conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSometimes it is necessary to work on Jupyter notebooks collaboratively e.g. when developing training material. In this case, try to break up the content as much as possible into separate notebooks, add new cells rather than edit existing ones, and communicate within your team who is working on what to avoid as much overlap as possible.\n\n\n\n\nThe truly nasty\nBinaries and generated outputs are the absolute worst merge conflicts to deal with. These cannot be merged - you must pick one version of the file to keep. They aren’t possible to resolve via GitHub - you have to use the git command-line interface or a graphical application like VSCode to solve them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe advice is - keep these files out of GitHub repositories! GitHub should store the software that generates these files, and perhaps the inputs to these files in some cases, but not the files themselves.\nIf you need the .html or .pdf in your repository, use GitHub Actions to generate them automatically (ask the RSE team if you want help with this!).\nThen we have one canonical compiler and workflow that generates everything - no issues from people compiling locally.\nIf this isn’t workable, at the very least, set up an Issue and document/ensure that everyone in the team uses the exact same versions of everything.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting the merged changes\nOnce you have resolved the conflict, you should commit-and-push your branch - it should now be ready for merging (subject to review!).",

Prevention is better than cure however!\n\n\nCreating a chapter in Quarto\nThe repository used to create this webpage is an example of this.\nThe key points are:\n\nCreate directories for the different chapters\nUpload the content in those chapters. e.g. \n\nmy-quarto-book/\n├── quarto.yml\n├── index.qmd\n├── chapter1/\n│   └── chapter1_content1.qmd\n│   └── chapter1_content2.qmd\n│   └── chapter1_index.qmd\n├── chapter2/\n│   └── chapter2_content.qmd\n│   └── chapter2_index.qmd\n├── chapter3/\n│   └── chapter3_content.qmd\n│   └── chapter2_index.qmd\n│   └──assets/\n│      └──picture_1.png\nHere we have assets (for e.g. images) inside the chapters rather than one big assets folder at the top level.\n\nUpdate quarto.yml under the book section to include your chapters.\n\nThen, if each chapter has several files (as in the case above - we have content1 and content2), we can nest them by creating new index.qmd for each chapter\n\n\n\nchapters:\n    - index.qmd\n\n    - part: chapter1/chapter1_index.qmd\n      chapters:\n        - chapter1/chapter1_content1.qmd \n        - chapter1/chapter1_content2.qmd\n\n    - part: chapter2/chapter2_index.qmd\n        chapters:\n        - chapter2/chapter2_content.qmd\n\n    - part: chapter3/chapter3_index.qmd \n        chapters:\n        - chapter3/chapter3_content.qmd\n      \n\nUse relative links to link chapters together\n\ne.g. from chapter3_content.qmd, you can link to chapter2_content.qmd like (link text)[../chapter2/chapter2_content.qmd].\n\n\nHave a look in the workshop repo if you want an example of this in action! It has an example of a GH Actions workflow (in .github/workflows/build_quarto.yml) to automatically publish and update the site whenever a commit or PR is made into main - coming to a future workshop near you…\n\n\nHow to cite effectively?\nThere are various ways. You can cite the GitHub repository itself if you don’t have a data description paper. The best bet is to use something similar to Zenodo. The main consideration is that you need your repository to be public - but this should be the case anyway if you’re citing it! You can also add a neat little badge to your README.md to link to the Zenodo page!\nFor stuff that’s more like tooling or methods, we could consider a submission to the Journal of Open Source Software. This differs from a normal journal in that papers are usually ~2 pages long, and focus more on the software than the application. Writing them is intended to be much simpler than a normal paper - the hard work is in developing the software itself!\n\n\nIdle thoughts\n\nDon’t worry about perfection straight away. Issues are where all your messy ideas can live. Worry about polish just before you’re ready to merge it in - remember main is where things need to be polished.\nDocumentation is key! You’re more likely to waste time/be stressed/want to quit academia when you can’t remember how and why you did anything down the line (and neither can your colleagues) writing a paper than you will spending 10 minutes a day/week writing documentation and populating Issues.\nThese might seem like restrictive or time-consuming behaviours, but they are standard practice for software developers for a reason - because they work.\n\nSoftware developers spend as much as possible trying to minimise the amount of work needing to be done so take heed their advice!\n\nIf a PR is hard to review, it is probably too big - in which case it is better to split across multiple issues/PRs.\n\nNot a particularly good heuristic for how big one should be - just make it as big as it needs to be but no bigger. The more moving parts there are the time it takes to review scales non-linearly!\n\nSharing code/putting it out for review, particularly as an academic rather than a software developer can seem daunting! But remember that these processes are there to make things better for everyone - this lets us all combine our strengths and learn things from one another.\n\nFeel free to request an RSE reviewer as well as an academic colleague - even if we don’t have time the worst we can do is say “no sorry”!\n\nIf you have questions or problems - reach out to the RSEs directly! Email, or there is an RSE page on Teams.\nDon’t worry if you don’t follow all of the guidelines all of the time! The intent is to improve the way we work, not to enforce orthodoxy for its own sake.",
