This document describes how we should work collaboratively in Imago repositories.

> Issue -> Branch -> Pull Request -> Review -> Merge -> Close


## 1. Create an Issue

- Work starts with Issues. Record the idea, problem, or goal.
- Describe what needs to be done and why.
- Add relevant background, links, or examples.
- Apply appropriate labels (e.g., feature, bug, enhancement).
- Tag people who are involved in the work you are doing.

## 2. Create a branch linked to the Issue

- Create a branch, not a fork.
- Name your branch something meaningful.
- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing outputs or system files.
- Clear Jupyter notebook outputs unless they are required for illustration.
- Commit small, coherent changes and push regularly so work is visible.

## 3. Develop your work

- Update the Issue with approaches tried and decisions made.
- Describe any failed approaches 
- Keep changes focused on the Issue (avoid unrelated edits).

## 4. Open a Pull Request

- Link the PR to the corresponding Issue(s) (e.g., Closes #23).
- Provide a clear summary of:
    - what changed,
    - why it changed,
    - how to test or verify it.

- Provide context so reviewers understand intent.
- If the work is not yet ready but you want feedback, create a Draft PR.
- Merge the `main` branch into your branch - resolve merge conflicts in your branch, not on `main`. 
- Apply appropriate labels and tags to the PR. 

## 5. Request review

- Request review from someone familiar with the codebase and subject domain.
- For large changes, notify reviewers early and/or split into smaller PRs.
- Don't merge your own PR without review unless the change is tested and trivial.

## 6. Review 

Reviewers should check:

- Does the change do what it claims?
- Does it affect other parts of the system?
- Is it clear and maintainable?

Feedback should be split into:

- *blockers* - must be fixed to merge.
- *advisories* - optional suggestions, e.g. extension ideas or minor/typo fixes.

Guidance for reviewers:

- Do suggest improvements - but review it *as is*, not *as you would have done it*. 
- If it does what the author intends and doesn't hold back other work, it should be approved.
- Use GitHub’s tools to comment on specific lines or provide structured feedback.
- Ensure that feedback is constructive and helps the author get their work merged.

> *Don't be Reviewer 2!*

## 7. Respond to feedback

- Address all blockers before merging.
- For advisories either:
    - implement the suggestion, or,
    - create a follow-up Issue.
- Mark conversations as resolved when complete.

## 8. Merge and tidy up

- Merge when the PR has at least one approval.
- Ensure linked Issues are auto-closed or manually closed.
- Update relevant documentation or examples.
