> **Goal**: Behaviours and workflows that make GitHub *save time* for our team.

This was designed for training researchers working on Imago on how to use GitHub. The materials herein may not reflect what are technically *best practices*
for a team of software devs, but are intended to aid researchers who are not familiar with GitHub use it for collaborative work.

Many of the examples and references here are to private Imago repositories. That said, 
this may still be a useful resource for ECRs elsewhere getting used to working with GitHub and exploring its 
core features.
