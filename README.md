# GitHub training for Imago staff

This repository contains materials used to train staff working on Imago data products on how to use GitHub effectively. 

Most PDRAs and many academics working on Imago data products have either not used GitHub, or only used it for individual projects. 
The aim of this material is to ease people with this level of experience into something approaching a standard GitHub workflow; using Issues, branches, PRs and some tips for code review.
The aim is to avoid jargon, and minimise cognitive load. 
Therefore, workflows like "trunk-based development" and "GitFlow" are not touched on here in favour of explaining the core concepts behind these workflows.

This material contains bespoke references to the needs of Imago staff, however it could be adapted for use as training material for academics more generally.
