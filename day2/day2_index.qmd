title: "Day 2 - Code review, merge conflicts and standard workflows"
---
 
This session focuses on **how we merge code into the `main` branch**.

Topics:
- Code review - and why it is useful
- How to avoid merge conflicts in the first place
- How to deal with the merge conflicts that do arise 
- Tips and tricks 
- Standard operating procedure (SOP)
- Q&A

These topics were not covered in the first GitHub workshop run by Batool - here I will introduce them and give some guidance on what to do if you 
are asked to review code or encounter merge conflicts.
